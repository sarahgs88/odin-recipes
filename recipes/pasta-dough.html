        <h1>Egg Pasta Dough Recipe</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is my go-to recipe for an egg based pasta dough adapted from Evan Funke. Egg based doughs are used for most filled pastas and are typical of Northern Italy.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>454 grams of 00 flour</li>
                    <li>256 grams of eggs</li>
                    <li>Plastic wrap</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the flour to a flat surface (preferably wood) and make a well in the center.</li>
                    <li>Pour the eggs into the well.</li>
                    <li>Using a fork, slowly mix the eggs together while incorporating the flour from the edges of the well to form a dough.</li>
                    <li>Form the mixture into a round dough and knead for 5 minutes until the surface is smooth.</li>
                    <li>Wrap the dough tighly in plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough in two and knead each dough until smooth and the dough bounces back when pressed.</li>
                    <li>Wrap each dough tightly in plastic wrap and set aside to rest.</li>
                </ol>
