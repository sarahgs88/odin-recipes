        <h1>Sweet Corn and Basil Ravioli</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This perfect summer dish brings together the bounty of the season. Corn isn't a typical filling in Italy, since much of the corn in Europe comes in cans. This recipe is homage to the fresh sweet corn that can be found across farmers markets in the U.S. throughout the hot season.</p>
        <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>454 grams of 00 flour</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h5>To make the pasta dough</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the flour to a flat surface (preferably wood) and make a well in the center.</li>
                    <li>Pour the eggs into the well.</li>
                    <li>Using a fork, slowly mix the eggs together while incorporating the flour from the edges of the well to form a dough.</li>
                    <li>Form the mixture into a round dough and knead for 5 minutes until the surface is smooth.</li>
                    <li>Wrap the dough tighly in plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough in two and knead each dough until smooth and the dough bounces back when pressed.</li>
                    <li>Wrap each dough tightly in plastic wrap and set aside to rest.</li>
                </ol>
            <h5>To make the filling</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a skillet pan and cut the kernels off of the ears of corn.</li>
                    <li>Add the kernels to the pan and cook for 10-12 minutes until they are soft. Season with the red pepper flakes to taste. If they start to char, add some water to the pan to deglaze.</li>
                    <li>When the kernels are cooked through, add them to a food processor and blend until the texture is smooth and consistent. Side aside a small portion of the mixture for the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add the basil, ricotta, Parmesean, salt, and black pepper to the food processor and blend until consistent.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate the filling until ready to use.</li>
                </ol>
            <h5>Assemble the ravioli</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Roll out the pasta dough to the thinness of 9 post-it notes.</li>
                    <li>Add small portions of filling to the dough depending on the desired size of your ravioli. Cover with the remaining dough and cut to size.</li>
                    <li>Set a pot of water to boil and season generously with salt.</li>
                    <li>Cook the ravioli in the boiling water until tender (1-2 minutes). Reserve some of the pasta water.</li>
                    <li>Add the remaining butter, blended corn, and heavy cream to the skillet pan on low heat. Once blended add the ravioli.</li>
                    <li>Remove the ravioli and top with extra sauce, parmesean, and basil.</li>
                </ol>
